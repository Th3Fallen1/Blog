      I changed the title of this blog, as Aditya Chaudhary's blog. <br>Why? Maybe I want people to find this, read my musings. Even when they can't possibly find this on their own. And nobody is even looking for this. I guess that says very much about human nature, and their constant need of approval, and how, I, too am no different than the flock of sheep-people that walk outside. Maybe I blame this on society, but I understand this is in my control. Are we even in control? Mr Robot dialogues coming to mind. Still, I choose to do this. Hmmm, I don't really care at this point. Or maybe I do? I don't know, I keep contradicting myself, and typing here instead of doing any actually work. Still I'm typing this philosophical shit, trying to impress someone. Who? Why? Maybe myself only. Idk.

      Should have named this Puzzles. Why is it called puzzles? that's the puzzle. A little HIMYM reference there for ya. But I like this. I'm keeping it like this. Not that, anybody else other than me is gonna even read it.

      Re-watching the entire Silicon Valley series. Got me in the mood for coding. That's why I started this. Even the logo of the blog is the new Pied Piper logo.

      This kinda feels like Zuckonit. Though I am not intoxicated, nor I need to vent my anger on someone right now, and most importantly, I don't know that much programming to create Facebook.

      This is my attempt at starting a fancy-pants blog. Will write whatever comes to mind.
