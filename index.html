      I am ending this blog. This isn't even a blog. It just doesn't feel genuine. This is all superficial. Just to show someone. Someone who won't even read this. I keep writing no one will read this, while dream someone will, and they will be like, "wow, he said no one will read it, and I am reading it." This just isn't real. And this is just a rant anyway. So, I'm ending this. This thing came full circle. Prophecy came true. These posts will remain in this code, as a comment. A record, of my cringing mediocrity to my future-self, who if I'm being honest will not be any different than me. Are you Aditya? IDK. This is will be buried here. I'll use the site for something else. CSS looks dope anyway. So, I guess this is goodbye. Maybe meet again, someday? Where will I look deep and mysterious and apart from society? May I'll keep coming here. Someday. Until then, I guess this is it. You expected something else? Nobody...except me. maybe through this I'll dissapoint myself again. Don't dissapoint me future Aditya. Just don't do it. Give it you best, I'll give it too. Just, please, okay, just, come on. hasta la vista, baby.

      Now here I am . PCM w/ CS. Pretntious douche people. Not only in my class, but I have gathered enough intel over the past years to know almost everyone in my standard is. Maybe I am one of them. I am. I'm constantly reminding myself I'm not. But subconciously, I too know, along with everyone, that I am a douche. I just don't punish other people for it. I think. Some do. People with so much pride and ego. If they read this, the first thought that would come to their mind would be, "what a hypocrytic prick". I know, it already happened at a micro-scale. mega-cringe. I am just rambling at this point. You are my therapist, Github code editor. I tell you this shit. You save it. I edit it, make it perfect for no one to view at a sub-domain no one can even find. Huh. What a douche I am.

      The stuff I like, movies, series, novels, and other miscellaneous things, I don't want other people to find them. I want to enjoy them myself. Is that selfish? Narcissistic, egoistic? I mean, even if they don't like it, I know most would, I still don't want them to find it. I want to cherish those myself, eventhough that is not good from that stuff's business perspective. If I find some genuine people, who are genuinely awesome, I may introduce those to them. <br>But that still hasn't happened yet. <br>I have one friend, who i still talked who, and he talked to me. But we changed streams in XI. I didn't introduce my favourite stuff to him, because he doesn't necessarily enjoy the stuff from my interests, and that's that.

      This is my personal twitter. Same useless stuff about the person writing them. Secluded from that wasteland. But in a wasteland of its own. This is my Twitter. This is my Alaska.

      Why Am I even obsessing over this? I am writing now, won't be in the near future. This will be inactive for most of its lifespan. Heck I even copied the CSS off some other guy's blog. This stuff seems too pessimistic. Feel like Hikigaya Hachiman. lmao. not really. I should complete my school stuff, instead of typing useless stuff here. I don't wanna though. Hey, Future me reading this, or by any miracle, someone other than me reading this, why are you? You've gotta be stupid to scroll this much down (on the possibility that I'm still shitposting random stuff). Why are you still here? Will you be here again? I hope so.

      I changed the title of this blog, to Aditya Chaudhary's blog. <br>Why? Maybe I want people to find this, read my musings. Even when they can't possibly find this on their own. And nobody is even looking for this. I guess that says very much about human nature, and their constant need of approval, and how, I, too am no different than the flock of sheep-people that walk outside. Maybe I blame this on society, but I understand this is in my control. Are we even in control? Mr Robot dialogues coming to mind. Still, I choose to do this. Hmmm, I don't really care at this point. Or maybe I do? I don't know, I keep contradicting myself, and typing here instead of doing any actually work. Still I'm typing this philosophical shit, trying to impress someone. Who? Why? Maybe myself only. Idk.

      Should have named this Puzzles. Why is it called puzzles? that's the puzzle. A little HIMYM reference there for ya. But I like this. I'm keeping it like this. Not that, anybody else other than me is gonna even read it.

      Re-watching the entire Silicon Valley series. Got me in the mood for coding. That's why I started this. Even the logo of the blog is the new Pied Piper logo.

      This kinda feels like Zuckonit. Though I am not intoxicated, nor I need to vent my anger on someone right now, and most importantly, I don't know that much programming to create Facebook.
