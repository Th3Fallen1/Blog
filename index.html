      Wow. Came to a full philosophical realisation in an hour. That's gotta be some type of world record am I right?

      This is my personal twitter. Same useless stuff about the person writing them. Secluded from that wasteland. But in a wasteland of its own. This is my Twitter. This is my Alaska.

      Why Am I even obsessing over this? I am writing now, won't be in the near future. This will be inactive for most of its lifespan. Heck I even copied the CSS off some other guy's blog. This stuff seems too pessimistic. Feel like Hikigaya Hachiman. lmao. not really. I should complete my school stuff, instead of typing useless stuff here. I don't wanna though. Hey, Future me reading this, or by any miracle, someone other than me reading this, why are you? You've gotta be stupid to scroll this much down (on the possibility that I'm still shitposting random stuff). Why are you still here? Will you be here again? I hope so.

      I changed the title of this blog, to Aditya Chaudhary's blog. <br>Why? Maybe I want people to find this, read my musings. Even when they can't possibly find this on their own. And nobody is even looking for this. I guess that says very much about human nature, and their constant need of approval, and how, I, too am no different than the flock of sheep-people that walk outside. Maybe I blame this on society, but I understand this is in my control. Are we even in control? Mr Robot dialogues coming to mind. Still, I choose to do this. Hmmm, I don't really care at this point. Or maybe I do? I don't know, I keep contradicting myself, and typing here instead of doing any actually work. Still I'm typing this philosophical shit, trying to impress someone. Who? Why? Maybe myself only. Idk.

      Should have named this Puzzles. Why is it called puzzles? that's the puzzle. A little HIMYM reference there for ya. But I like this. I'm keeping it like this. Not that, anybody else other than me is gonna even read it.

      Re-watching the entire Silicon Valley series. Got me in the mood for coding. That's why I started this. Even the logo of the blog is the new Pied Piper logo.

      This kinda feels like Zuckonit. Though I am not intoxicated, nor I need to vent my anger on someone right now, and most importantly, I don't know that much programming to create Facebook.

      This is my attempt at starting a fancy-pants blog. Will write whatever comes to mind.
